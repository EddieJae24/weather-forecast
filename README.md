  ## Description
 The Weather Dashboard is a web application that allows users to search for current and future weather conditions for cities around the world. The app uses the OpenWeather 5-Day Forecast API to retrieve and display weather data, including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and an icon representation of the conditions. Users can save cities to their search history for quick access and remove them when no longer needed.
